# Amazon Pathfinder Coding Challenge
## Overview
Challenge to implement Amazons Pathfinder Algorithm for Amazon's self driving vehicles. The self driving vehicle will need to create a path on a 2D-grid that contains a starting point (x,y), a delivery point (x,y) and a number of obstacles. Your vehicle can navigate to any of the adjacent squares (even diagonally) as long as the squares are inbound and do not contain an obstacle.
